## States to Check:
### For each state that needs checking, either say it's approved or needs fixing (if so, list the error)

1. South Carolina - needs checking ---Xiaojun : I think South Carolina has more data than that shown in the file. eg. https://scdhec.gov/sites/default/files/media/document/T10.pdf  PDF from this web link has more PFAS data we want. (fixed, can you check the new table? it's called south_carolina1.csv. thanks!)
3. iowa - Xiaojun : Checked (NOTE: Drinking and raw water samples are put together in this table as one rather than in separate datasets, but you can distinguish them in the "Facility Name" column)
4. kentucky - Xiaojun : Checked
5. wyoming
6. alaska (each of the tables on different pdfs are combined into one)
7. virginia
8. north dakota
9. 

To check: South Carolina (new table added, see note), Wyoming, Alaska (see note), Virginia, North Dakota
