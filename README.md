## States to Check:
### For each state that needs checking, either say it's approved or needs fixing (if so, list the error)

1. South Carolina - needs checking ---Xiaojun : I think South Carolina has more data than that shown in the file. eg. https://scdhec.gov/sites/default/files/media/document/T10.pdf  PDF from this web link has more PFAS data we want. 
2. iowa - remove duplicate column rows (needs checking for other inconsistencies)
3. kentucky - needs checking
4. wyoming - will be added

another test
